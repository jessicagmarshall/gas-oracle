# GAS ORACLES BABY
Okay guys, so hopefully I will have pushed this somehow from the middle of nowhere Malaga Spain.
Here's what you need to know:
1. Prediction market contracts are all in `/contracts/` folder
2. Throughout the repo, the gas oracle should be similar to `CentralizedOracle.sol` in implementation and deployment.
3. `GasOracle.sol` and `GasOracleFactory.sol` should go in `/contracts/oracles` and have implementation similar to `CentralizedOracle.sol`.
4. Edit `/migrations/2_deploy_gnosis_contracts.js` so that `GasOracleFactory.sol` is linked and deployed.
5. There is a javascript test in `/test/javascript/test_oracles.js` that goes through the exact steps to deploy a prediction market using the contracts deployed in the migration script in 4.
6. Jess should know how to spin up a UI so that people can bet on gas prices, however, Tim just put up a tutorial called petshop in the truffleframework tutorials that will walk you through basics.
